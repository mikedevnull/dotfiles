# Dotfiles

My dotfiles managed using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).


### Getting started

Thanks to dotbot, installation and setup is quite easy.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mikedevnull/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./install
```

#### Vim plugin setup

To install all plugins after a fresh install/update,
   executing the `:PlugInstall` in vim is neccessary.
